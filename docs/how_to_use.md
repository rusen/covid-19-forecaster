# Our step-by-step guide on how to use Covid Trip Planner.

## 1) Enter the website upon agreeing to our T&Cs.

Use the website at your own risk.

## 2) Select the week that you would like to travel, using the slider bar below.

Covid Trip Planner makes Covid-19 risk predictions for 700+ destinations for the upcoming weeks. Select a week by clicking its marker.

## 3) Search for or zoom into the destination you would like to go.

You will see the predicted state of the world based on the selected week. Zoom in, or search for the destination that you have in mind.

### 4) Click on the marker of a country, city or region to get the latest  travel advice and predictions.

The travel advice card for a destination includes the following:
* Our Covid-19 weekly case estimates for the next few weeks,
* official travel advice (by UK Foreign Office & USA State Dept.),
* current risk assessment level (by UK Foreign Office & USA State Dept.),
* our predicted risk assessment level for the selected week (w.r.t. UK Foreign Office & USA State Dept. criteria).

### 5) Make informed predictions for future plans

Covid Trip Planner currently does not take national restrictions into account. It only contains *foreign* travel advice by UK and USA. Please check the national restrictions of your destination and home country before you book your travel.

Please follow the travel advice of your host country. Modelling Covid-19 spread is a very difficult research problem, and *even public health experts get it wrong*.

**Exercise your own judgement. Use at your own risk.**
